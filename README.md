# AdmSim: an R package for simulations of Genetic Admixture

This is the first version of the package AdmSim, developed for my final project in University College Dublin.

## Installing the package
If you would like to install the package from source, move to the location where AdmSim directory is contained and in R run the following command:

```
install.packages("AdmSim", repos = NULL, type = "source")
```

### Prerequisites

The package needs the following R packages:

- **parallel**: a package for parallel computing in R;
- **magrittr**:  a Forward-Pipe Operator for R.

Packages can be easily installed via command:
```
install.packages("magrittr")
install.packages("parallel")
```
